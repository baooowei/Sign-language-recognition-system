Sign language is a body language specifically used for communication among deafpeople. Using algorithmic technology to build a sign language recognition system that automatically recognizes gesture movements translated into a language understood by normal people can help deaf people to better integrate into society. Moreover, in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI)  and computer vision, sign language recognition technology has better naturalness, ease of use and security. Therefore, sign language recognition is a research topic with practical significance and application value. The main purpose of this project is to build a system on sign language recognition based on  YOLOv5 object detection model.
